# The AAS Code Generation Tool for Java

This is a tool for the automated creation of a Java library containing all classes, properties and enumerations of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) Metamodel. The tool itself is completly written in Java and uses the shapes constraint language (SHACL) to specify annotations and cardinalities for the Java classes.
