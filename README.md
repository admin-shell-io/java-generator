# Industrial Data Space Java Code Generation Tool (Fraunhofer IAIS/EIS implementation)

This is a tool for the automated creation of a Java library containing all classes, properties and enumerations of the Industrial Data Space (IDS) Information Model. The tool itself is completly written in Java and uses the shapes constraint language (SHACL) to specify annotations and cardinalities for the Java classes. The resulting JAR is the foundation for all higher-level IDS interactions and components as developed by Fraunhofer IAIS.

In addition to several tests and quality checks, the tool also exports a UML-like illustration of all classes and their relations and attributes.
